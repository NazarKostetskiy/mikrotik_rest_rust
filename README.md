# Mikrotik REST client on rust.
HTTP Client for mikrotik REST API.

Backend application on rust that implements simple wrapper on mirkotik REST API. \
Will be used for monitoring and fetching logs, traffic and performance visualization and monitoring. \
Took https://crates.io/crates/mikrotik/0.0.10 for HTTP client as example, but there are absent a lot of resources.
